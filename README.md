## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
- A Tuesday API key (get one at [app.tuesday.so](https://app.tuesday.so/settings/api))

### Step-by-Step Local Installation

#### 1. Clone and Setup the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tuesday-mcp.git
cd tuesday-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

#### 2. Set Your API Key

Create a `.env` file or set environment variable:

```bash
# Option A: Create .env file in project root
echo "TUESDAY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env

# Option B: Export environment variable
export TUESDAY_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

#### 3. Test the Server

```bash
# Test that the server starts correctly
node dist/index.js
```

You should see: `Tuesday MCP server started successfully`

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the test.

### Configure Your AI Assistant

#### Option 1: Claude Desktop

1. **Find your configuration file:**
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Edit the configuration file:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tuesday": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/tuesday-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TUESDAY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Get the absolute path:**

```bash
# Run this in your tuesday-mcp directory to get the full path
pwd
# Copy the output and append "/dist/index.js"
# Example: /Users/yourname/projects/tuesday-mcp/dist/index.js
```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**

#### Option 2: Cursor

1. **Open Cursor Settings**
2. **Navigate to Extensions â†’ MCP**
3. **Add server configuration:**

```json
{
  "tuesday": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/absolute/path/to/tuesday-mcp/dist/index.js"],
    "env": {
      "TUESDAY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Restart Cursor**

#### Option 3: Continue.dev

1. **Edit your Continue config** (`.continue/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tuesday": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/tuesday-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TUESDAY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Restart Continue extension**

#### Option 4: Any MCP-Compatible Client

For any other MCP client, use these connection details:

- **Transport**: stdio
- **Command**: `node`
- **Arguments**: `["/absolute/path/to/tuesday-mcp/dist/index.js"]`
- **Environment**: `{"TUESDAY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"}`

### Verify Installation

#### 1. Check MCP Server Recognition

In your AI assistant, try:
```
"List available tools"
```

You should see Tuesday tools like `search_people`, `search_companies`, etc.

#### 2. Test API Connection

```
"Check if my Tuesday API key is valid"
```

You should get workspace information confirming the connection.

#### 3. Test Basic Search

```
"Find software engineers in San Francisco"
```

This should return search results from the Tuesday API.

### Troubleshooting Setup

#### Common Issues

1. **"Command not found" or "Tool not available"**

   npm run build
   
   # Check the absolute path is correct
   ls -la /your/absolute/path/to/tuesday-mcp/dist/index.js
   ```

2. **"API key invalid"**
   ```bash
   # Test your API key directly
   curl -H "X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here" https://api.tuesday.so/api/v1/public/auth
   ```

3. **"Server won't start"**
   ```bash
   # Check for dependency issues
   npm install
   npm run build
   
   # Run with debug output
   DEBUG=* node dist/index.js
   ```

4. **"Permission denied"**
   ```bash
   # Make sure the file is executable
   chmod +x dist/index.js
   ```

## API Reference

### Rate Limits

Please refer to the [Tuesday API documentation](https://docs.tuesday.so/rate-limits-and-credits) for current rate limits and best practices.

### Error Handling

The MCP server provides comprehensive error handling:

- **Authentication errors**: Invalid or missing API keys
- **Validation errors**: Invalid input parameters
- **API errors**: Rate limiting, insufficient credits, etc.
- **Network errors**: Connection issues, timeouts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Tool not found" errors**
   - Restart your AI assistant
   - Check the MCP server configuration
   - Verify the server is running

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check environment variable is set
   - Ensure sufficient credits

3. **No results returned**
   - Try broader search criteria
   - Check if the company/person exists
   - Verify parameter spelling

4. **Too many parameters error**
   - Some filters may be mutually exclusive
   - Try using fewer filters at once
   - Check parameter format (arrays vs. objects)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
export DEBUG=tuesday-mcp:*
node dist/index.js
```
